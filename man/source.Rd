}
\arguments{
\item{file}{a \link{connection} or a character string giving the
    pathname of the file or URL to read from.  \code{""} indicates the
    connection \code{\link{stdin}()}.}

\item{code_tree_string}{character string giving the name of a data.frame to augment, or create if this is the first use}

\item{frame}{frame or environment in which to find data.frame named code_tree_string}

\item{local}{\code{TRUE}, \code{FALSE} or an environment, determining
    where the parsed expressions are evaluated.  \code{FALSE} (the
    default) corresponds to the user's workspace (the global
    environment) and \code{TRUE} to the environment from which
    \code{source} is called.}

evaluates code in the file argument, and also augments or creates a dataframe with two variables (parent, child).
The intention is to record the architecture of a sequenece of code files run using nested source() statements. To override this function use
\code{source <- base::source}.
